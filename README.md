# Python Dollar to Real Exchange Rate
This project was created with the main objective to learn Python language.
The Python Dollar-to-Real script checks the current exchange rate using a free API. Set a task to run every hour on Windows Task Scheduler. Data colected is stored in a CVS file, which serves as a Database. Every day, the script sends a email with the current exchange rate and the variation history for the last 5 days.
